The only thing that I would say they did wrong was not enough fighting and action. There was so much depth to this character and is perfect if you are in love with the marvel universe. If you are just a person who likes action a ton, this movie may not be for you but if you admire the way marvel is becoming, you will love this movie. Don't watch this movie with a negative attitude towards it. Give it a chance and you will be surprised!",

          "CAPTAIN MARVEL is the latest Marvel comics offering and the follow-up to AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR; inevitably it's a big step down from the success of that movie. This one goes down a much more predictable route, and it suffers hugely from having a main character who simply isn't very interesting; like Superman, her immortality and strength make her rather boring to see on screen. The film also suffers from having an unimposing villain, a crucial climactic scene openly copying RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, and generic action. On the plus side: there's a nice supporting turn from a funny and de-aged Samuel L. Jackson; the material on Earth is gently amusing, riffing on the buddy-buddy genre; there's a solid and major plot twist halfway through that really works; and Brie Larson is a decent actress. But they really need to think of something more involved next time instead of this generic amnesic hero stuff.",

          "I respect the different opinions, but I don't agree when people say that the movie sucks, Larson's actong is horrible and it's a weak movie. I just cannot agree!\nCapitain Marvel is fantastic!! Brie Larson does a nice job playing as Carol Danvers, Sam Jackson also does very well playing as a younger Nick Fury and I really enjoyed the Skrull leader Talos.\nAlso, the visual effects are incredible and the action scenes are really nice. I just don't give a ten because I believe the action scenes could have been more exciting, like in Infinity War, but it was good enough for me.\nResuming: Capitain Marvel is an action-packed movie that may not be as epic as IW and Civil War, but it holds your attention the full time and introduces the most powerful character in the MCU, who is gonna kick Thanos's ass in Avengers: Endgame!\nObs: watch the two post- credits scenes. Both will be important to understand some hints about Endgame.",

          "I don't want to adress the hate, but let's try to forget it for a second and just appreciate the film for what it is: a film. thank you.First of all, the intro of the mcu logo was great. youll see what i mean when you see the film and I appreciate the creators for doing it as they did.Now... first the good stuff:\n1. Samuel L. Jackson: He played a more softened Nick Fury, but very much \"agent coulson prior avengers\" like, with a lot of attitude, sarcastic humor and less serious. Also the de-aging is becoming so good, that you wouldnt even be able to notice it even if you really looked. His character was very well done on script and screen.2. Some of the action: The space battle stuff etc. was very well done. the special effects team did an amazing job at this movie. nothing felt or looked fake. kudos!3. Surprise surprise: the story. From the trailers you would not be able to predict this but the story is actually really interesting. The way they introduce her past was very originally done. The way she remembers things through different ways was clever.. very clever even, because it doesnt make her past like an obstacle you first gotta go through.. it added to the story while adding to her character. Also multiple twist and 1 big one that even got me thinking for a while.4. Ben Mendelson: really impressive job. very layered surpringsly and stand out in my books. the acting is general was very goodthe bad:1. It misses spectacle... and a standout moment. in thor 3 for example; you had the intro scene, and the end scene which were big standout moments and a manifestation of thor's powers. i feel you didnt get that in this movie.2. Like I said the story was great, the execution a.k.a. the screenplay/script lacked... they had such great storypoints, but they were all done so quickly and those moments lacked emotion. the friendship between carol and her friend didnt feel real. she seemed to have a more genuine relationship with her kid rather than with her and that bothered me a bit, since they seemed all buddy buddy in the past and even during some moments in the film where i was like; \"but you didnt deserve that yet...\" Ben's character had a more emotional impact on me than carol... yikes!! (and i dont mean that in a killmonger-t'challa kind of way)3. some of the action again: some action just wasn't good. there is a moment she is fighting the skrull(the moment she yells at the skrull in the trailer) and that whole fighting sequence was horribly filmed and choreographed... which is weird, because she another scene where she is fighting the skrull in the film and then the action seemed way better filmed.All in all, the film was good. nothing more and nothing less. i missed an emotional attachment to the main character. I felt like i still didnt know her after the film, and i think that's because they tried to give her a certain personality that just didnt fit the film. she was supposed to be a bit arrogant, but i wouldve loved to see more vulnerablity in a woman that is the STRONGEST creature in the world and they made me believe that btw. she come across as amazingly powerfull at one point in the film. believe me! Wonderwoman's vulnerability and her femine side me fall in love with the character and they stripped that away fromm carol, and basically made her less relatable.so that's why i gave it a 7. it's definitely a good time in the theatre and some of the scenes are quite the spectacle and i loved the shock and awe that some scenes provided. especially the way she got her powers(hihihi geeks out). Go see it. it is nowhere near as bad as iron man 2/thor 2, but it doesn't touch civil war, infinity war etc. either, its like rifght in the middle. inbetween those 20+ films.",

          "This movie feels out of place in the MCU, it feels Fury is not the same character we meet (only) 10 years later. The movie tries to force us to like Brie Larson, not Carol Danvers or Captain Marvel. The character feels like a mix between Tony Stark, Thor and Feminist Captain America. To make things worse, at the end she is way to OP. However, the movie had some good jokes, it was not over preachy. Sure there where some Cringe moments, but all in all it could be worse. The best part of this movie is the 90's nostalgia, Ben Medelsohn, Fury&Goose and The Kree. BUT the Kree do not get that much screen time, they feel like The Warriors 3 with even less to do. The intro does gave me shivers, what a tribute to Stan Lee. I would say Captain Marvel is Solo: A Star Wars Story mixed with The Incredible Hulk, a fun popcorn movie but nothing more.",

          "PlotCarol Danvers becomes one of the universe's most powerful heroes when Earth is caught in the middle of a galactic war between two alien races.CastBrie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson (Because duh), Jude \"Just consistently dreadful\" Law, Annette Bening, Djimon Hounsou, Clark Gregg and blink and you'll miss him Lee Pace who returns as Ronan but looks so different I didn't even think it was him.VerdictI watched this back when it was initially released, I watched it a second time a few days ago as the missus is wanting us to binge watch the entire MCU as she's very behind. My opinion has changed on the 2nd viewing and not in a good way, my rating has shifted from a 6/10 to 5/10.You see straight out of the gate the first thing you notice about Carol Danvers is she's not really a character you can get behind. She's not funny, she's not entertaining, she comes across as a surly teenage girl who is just upset at the slightest thing and just doesn't want to be there. This is not a character you can build a movie around, like trying to make a teenage Groot movie! It wouldn't work, but he's okay as a side character.Supporting cast are also hit and miss, Jackson and Gregg are great,\nbut Lynch and Law just stink up every scene they're in.I'm a Marvel fan but I recognize where it's weak, this is a distinctly average film that serves as a standalone origin story and doesn't contribute much to the universe as a whole.RantsI remember when the movie came out all the controversy with Brie Larson, I just had to Google what the controversy even was as I don't remember due to not focusing on such things. Now I can't really get a definitive answer. From what I see it's a combination of people not liking her attitude and her comments on feminism. So I Googled further to see what she said, she came across arrogant in them and a smidge out of touch but none of it explained the overwhelming hate I've seen aimed at her. Then I remembered that people talk about all the different types of bigotry but misogyny rarely comes up, I remembered that it's visibly increased over the past decade and appreciated why she's been targeted. News flash, the outspoken loud brash man hating femnists you likely thing of when you hear that word make up a very small percentage. Feminism is good, if you disagree I hope you simply don't know the meaning of the word.The GoodJackson and Gregg\nHas a couple of decent moments\nNot a bad soundtrack\nGoose!The BadLarson isn't great\nLaw and Lynch are terrible\nLead just comes across unlikable.Overall just a weak entry to the MC.",

There is no point at which you feel she is in any danger of losing, or any danger at all for that matter.It's an OK origin story, but it makes no sense as to WHY she's supposedly so powerful.The cat was good.",

Dont know why I decided to write about this movie.I agree with most mediocre reviews I read here.The pacing was pretty good.Most of the action was good!The story was ok and had some good twists.I thought about giving this movie a 6 but after letting it sink in I decided to give it 8 out of 10It entertained me and my company from beginning to end.There were some eye rolling moments but they are easily forgiven.",

The acting was good, it had Marvel's characteristic laughs, and the feminism was just enough not to be preachy. If you want to go see a movie about a kick-a** woman superhero figuring herself out and overcoming surprising obstacles, this is your movie.",

          "I believe Screen Junkies put it best, this is a Phase One Movie in a Phase Three world. This is the first marvel film in a while that felt that the direction was faceless. Where the Russo's, Waititi, Gunn, Coogler, and even Reed (Among Others) shined Fleck and Boden's direction felt fairly faceless as the film comes off as just another Marvel outing. However it's not without it's charm. The visuals are stellar to look at, and the makeup on the fan-favorite Skrulls is a sight for sore eyes. The performances by Jackson and Mendelssohn are fantastic, but the movie wouldn't be anything without its leading lady. Brie Larson turns is a fine performance and it's great to see this character finally integrated into the MCU, however she's given very little to work with, and there's not much that truly distinguishes her yet, that's not the fault of Larson, just a writing and direction problem. The film is a fine spectacle, and a nice solo venture, but there's just not much originality that we've seen with the past slate of Marvel films.",

          "So I was hoping this would be a great movie and I could write a review telling misogynists to shut up because it's fantastic to have a strong female superhero as a lead character. Alas, in that regard Wonder Woman did a lot better as a movie as a whole.The acting is not that great between Brie Larson's poor performance and the prosthetic/GCI on Samuel L. Jackson that makes him look younger but also gives him an expressionless wooden appearance. There are very obvious plot holes (like, wait, how did they know to do that?) and the pacing is very uneven; there are a few parts during which I didn't feel engaged at all.On the plus side it does fairly well as an origin story, and there is that Marvel level of polish in special effects and editing. All in all, it might be a necessary introduction to Captain Marvel for Avengers End Game, but it is probably the weakest MCU movie to date.EDIT: 2 years later and I watched it a second time as part of my MCU chronological order marathon, and it is actually better than I originally felt. A lot of the above points still stand but I was a bit harsh because it didn't meet my expectations at the time. I now change my original 6/10 to a 7/10 as it's a fairly entertaining movie and is truly an essential part of the MCU saga leading to Endgame.",

It's great to see the JARVIS clips and it's emotional that the episode ends not long after Vision's death in Infinity WarTHE FALCON - The worst episode of the first four. It wasn't amusing and was barely about Sam. It was largely just clips of other charactersTHE WINTER SOLIDER - It was alright. Not nearly as good as I hoped, but I'm still hyped for The Falcon And The Winter SoliderZEMO - Zemo is one of my favourite villains in the MCU so I honestly loved this. His backstory is so tragic and to see this was very saddeningSHARON CARTER - Another alright episode. One of the worst of the current six episodes, but it was fun to see the events of Winter Solider and Civil War from Sharon's perspectiveLOKI - Loki has been through a lot of development throughout the Infinity Saga so this is one of the best episodes in the show. Really fun to watchTHE TESSERACT - This was a very unnecessary episode, but it's still a fun watch.BLACK WIDOW - Natasha is one of my favourite characters in the MCU and this captures her quite well, but it is still difficult to capture nine years worth of her in movies in a ten minute montage.",

          "I'm ranking this seven stars because the first seven episodes are worth 10 stars each. Each one was presented a good two months after the finish of their televised series. We get to hear from the actors and actresses about their experiences playing the role. We get to hear from the directors about their vision from when they started until the finished product that we all saw. We get to see all kinds of behind the scenes footage about how it was made. I'm not going to swear persay, but fing awesome!The next 5 episodes are worth about one star. They are essentially overblown trailers for movies that we've already seen before (Twice? Three times?). Maybe there was some sort of contractual obligation that required that they had to meet 12 episodes in a given amount of time? To be honest, as a fan, I would rather wait for the next episode of Marvel Legends two or three months after the fact and witness all the good and the bad about how it was made. Movies and series alike.",

Some of the episodes of \"Assembled\" are really great and take you through many different parts of the production. I especially liked when they would theme the episode to match the show or movie itself which they're not doing too often. The X Men 97' episode was nice, but I was disappointed they focused mainly on the nostalgia aspect and about the history of the show and comics instead of showing us the actual work behind the scenes- the redesigns, storytelling, the animation etc...",

          "For a long time now I've had a big problem with Marvel Studios' behind the scenes content. The MCU is the biggest franchise on the planet arguably but their special features on the DVDs and Blu-Rays have been extremely lazy and lackluster ever since Disney bought the franchise. When this was announced I was praying that it would finally be the MCU BTS content I've been craving for years, but in the end it was more of the same. Here are my two biggest issues:1) The background music. It's so loud, obnoxious and incessant. I find it so difficult to actually hear in the information I'm here for. It's okay Marvel I won't lose interest during quiet moments.2) The editing. Marvel behind the scenes featurettes are all edited in the style of those short-form, minute long, special look behind the scenes videos Marvel posts to social media to get fans hyped for an upcoming movie. They're basically quasi-trailers that feature the cast or directors explaining the general plot of an upcoming movie paired with footage of the film and couple tidbits of b-roll or on-set footage sprinkled in.The MCU as a franchise, it's producers, directors, actors, VFX artists, production designers and concept artists all deserve a proper deep dive into their work on the level of The Lord of the Rings behind the scenes for The Matrix trilogy for example. This isn't even a Disney problem per-se because Star Wars still has excellent behind the scenes on their Blu-Rays too.But Marvel's behind the scenes content, including this show are basically glorified special look trailers extended. They're edited in the same snappy, quick, loud and flashy manner that trailers are and when this content becomes longer than a couple minutes it becomes extremely annoying and grating.Assembled is primarily just the actors and directors explaining the show we've already seen over footage of the show we've already watched with a few moments of actual behind the scenes sprinkled in. It's as though they're selling us a product we've already all bought. Now Assembled isn't as guilty of this as the BTS featurettes on the Blu-Rays. We do actually get some decent looks into the production of WandaVision, especially in the first third that explores the 50s and 60s episodes, but after that it's basically a giant recap with the writers and actors.I think overall my problem is that I feel pandered to. I don't come to behind the scenes content to get a glorified summary of a show or movie I've already seen. I want to see how it was actually made. And I don't need constant music and quick cuts to keep my attention. I can just watch craftspeople doing their craft for a while. I love just seeing directors direct with the actual on-set sound in the background, or seeing costume designers talk us through their process, or VFX artists explain in detail how they did what they did. This stuff is extremely interesting its what we're all here to see.BTS content is why I wanted to get into the film industry in the first place. Overall this was a fun glimpse into the making of the show but it was just that, a glimpse. I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know. I really hope one day the MCU can give us some making of content worthy of the final product we all love.TLDR: Basically just a glorified recap than an actual Making Of show.",

          "This series is episodic, so it is better to rate individual episodes. The series is ongoing, and I will update my review as I watch new episodes.9/10 - These episodes don't waste time by retelling the movie's/show's story, but rather focus on deep dives into casting, character development, screenwriting, stunt work, effects, costume/set design, music, cinematography, etc.* Loki (season 2)7/10 - These episodes don't have any mind-blowing new trivia, and they still focus a bit too much on simply retelling the movie's/show's story, but they check all the boxes for a good behind-the-scenes documentary by exploring the casting, screenwriting, stunt work, effects, costume/set design, etc.* Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* Hawkeye* Black Panther: Wakanda Forever* Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol 3* Echo5/10 - These episodes have some good info and I'm glad I watched them, but at least 50% of the show follows the series' terrible 2/10 formula.* WandaVision* What If...?* Eternals* She-Hulk: Attorney at Law* Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* Secret Invasion2/10 - These episodes contain no new information and are essentially in-depth plot recaps of the movie/show that you already watched, as told by the leading cast & crew.* The Falcon and the Winter Soldier - This one is particularly heartbreaking to watch as you can see all of the cast are genuinely excited for the show, believing themselves to be part of something that will be amazing, but completely oblivious to the fact that the director and screenwriters are destroying everything good about the series by trying to pull the plot in too many directions at once.* Loki (season 1)* Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* Ms Marvel1/10 - Same 2/10 formula, except they either completely ignore or fail to explain the decisions behind elements that were drastically changed for the worse compared to the comics.* Black Widow - When talking about Taskmaster, they all but directly say \"Diversity is literally the only thing required to make a good movie/show\" as if that somehow justified their decision to destroy every element of the character that fans enjoy and turn him/her into one of many mindless martial arts masters in the MCU, which was a horrendous decision regardless of the character's gender. They also state \"Black Widow is unique because she is just really well trained and isn't actually a superhero\" while completely ignoring the fact that they bizarrely gave her superhuman strength and endurance for this film.* Thor: Love and Thunder - actual quote: \"Don't worry about (all the previous Thor movies). You can pretty much forget everything about them.\"* Werewolf by Night - 15 minutes of \"making of\" documentary buried alongside 40 minutes of the director's family home videos.",

          "It is by far more disrespectful to not recast Tchalla than to recast him.To not recast him to me it seems like there is a ulterior motive. Probably jealousy or maybe a bigoted issue.To not have Tchalla in a BP movie makes no sense. If fans really care or have sense they will boycott BP2 and future BP movies until Tchalla is casted.It's very disrespectful. First current age major so called black hero and he gets swept under the rug.I get it mr. 42 aka Boseman apparently passed away.So have many James Bond's and Superman.Boseman did not own or make Tchalla or BP. Stan Lee and Kirby created him and now Disney owns Black Panther. Okay since Stan Lee and Kirby passed why not cancel the mcu?Since Walt Disney is dead why not cancel Disney?Overall, I feel it's disrespectful to not recast Tchalla than it is to recast him. BP2 will seem very stupid to not have Tchalla. Any in story reason for Tchalla not being around will sound horrible and rushed.BP2 will likely be worse than the first.",

          "This anthology documentary series is, yes, an unashamed series of what amount to bloated corporate adverts for the Marvel company but they're slickly produced and quite engrossing really. In order the series is quite top-heavy with the excellent and quite touching Japanese Spider-Man and Higher, Further, Faster standing head and shoulders above the others structurally. As someone who does work in comics (at a far lower rung I should add) the Marvel Method and Artisans episodes are solid and fairly authentic glimpses into the realities of putting together books. I mean, they mention letterers by name which frankly gets it a pass from me, a skill so vital to the form and yet so undervalued it rarely gets discussed anywhere else so fair play to that.On the surface - these are just long adverts for Marvel as a brand rather than anything truly investigative or searingly observant but in fulfilling their assignments the various documentarians do get a little under the skin of what makes it such a fascinating industry and such a unique company. It feels limited by dry corporate constraints when covering a really wide field like cosplay, or something that could have been more meaningful like the school play episode - but when looking into the craft itself (whether that's making comics, action figures or a strange Japanese TV show in the 70s) it does scratch something real and fair play to it for that. Also, Paul Scheer.",

          "A series of Marvel documentaries?! Sign me up! - is what i initially thought.\nBut a few episodes in, I couldn't help but feel that Marvel's 616's main purpose is to sell Marvel merchandise and propagandize recent titles. Only the episode on the Japanese Spiderman TV series struck a true documentary tone and I loved learning about how that series came about. The other episodes strike a classic, TV paid programming tone of commercials masquerading as content.",
