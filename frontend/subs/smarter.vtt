00:00:14.927 --> 00:00:17.241
I’m a smarter baby, smarter

00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.334
Smarter baby, smarter

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:21.454
Just one word I know the rest

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.566
I see through and break through

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.779
Wanna be a winner

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.951
Wanna be a winner

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:29.708
It's all going to plan

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.104
I'm a newbie soon to be a butterfly

00:00:32.287 --> 00:00:36.184
What I want is victory

00:00:36.184 --> 00:00:38.184
I call it “sugar”

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:44.738
I'll never lose if all goes to plan

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:47.438
My sugar, sugar

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:51.801
They say I'm mean-mean-mean-mean-mean

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.801
I don't care sh-sh-sh-sh-sh

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:55.984
Instead of beauty blossomed from my defeat

00:00:55.984 --> 00:00:57.984
I chose the more powerful "villain" instead

00:00:57.984 --> 00:01:00.298
So that's me-me-me-me-me

00:01:00.298 --> 00:01:02.451
I see-see-see-see-see

00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:05.911
LE SSERAFIM leads me to victory

00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.114
I’m a smarter baby, smarter

00:01:08.114 --> 00:01:10.357
Smarter baby, smarter

00:01:10.357 --> 00:01:12.408
Just one word I know the rest

00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:14.591
I see through and break through

00:01:14.591 --> 00:01:16.774
Wanna be a winner

00:01:16.774 --> 00:01:18.794
Wanna be a winner

00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:20.794
It's all going to plan

00:01:20.794 --> 00:01:22.926
I'm a newbie soon to be a butterfly

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:24.236
I’m a smarter baby

00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:26.115
Work hard in secret

00:01:26.115 --> 00:01:28.196
Everything like clockwork

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:31.413
I planned that, don’t be mad

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:35.614
If all goes to plan I'll never be

00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:38.446
That loser, loser

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:42.750
They say I'm mean-mean-mean-mean-mean

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.780
I don't care sh-sh-sh-sh-sh

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.881
Instead of beauty blossomed from my defeat

00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:49.053
I chose the more powerful "villain" instead

00:01:49.053 --> 00:01:51.347
So I just wanna be me-me-me-me

00:01:51.347 --> 00:01:53.611
I can see-see-see-see-see

00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.858
LE SSERAFIM leads me to victory

00:01:56.858 --> 00:01:59.203
I’m a smarter baby, smarter

00:01:59.203 --> 00:02:01.203
Smarter baby, smarter

00:02:01.203 --> 00:02:03.315
Just one word I know the rest

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:05.609
I see through and break through

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:07.670
Wanna be a winner

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.761
Wanna be a winner

00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:11.761
It's all going to plan

00:02:11.761 --> 00:02:13.761
I'm a newbie soon to be a butterfly

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:15.477
I’m a smarter baby

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.777
My clock goes tick-tock

00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:17.834
Much needed shortcut

00:02:17.834 --> 00:02:19.611
Found one, and I took it, huh

00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:20.878
They say “that’s all luck”

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:21.965
I say, “no, it’s not luck"

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:23.458
My sweat's not lying, lying

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:25.813
Don’t slow down, this life's super fast

00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:27.935
Best scheme, all mapped out

00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm ready for the best fulfilling life

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.844
Dinner of the winner,

00:02:30.844 --> 00:02:31.820
That is what I want to get

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.080
I’m a smarter baby, smarter

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.323
Smarter baby, smarter

00:02:35.323 --> 00:02:37.414
Just one word I know the rest

00:02:37.414 --> 00:02:39.607
I see through and break through

00:02:39.607 --> 00:02:41.688
Wanna be a winner

00:02:41.688 --> 00:02:43.810
Wanna be a winner

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.688
It's all going to plan

00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:47.820
I'm a newbie soon to be a butterfly

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.465
I’m a smarter baby
